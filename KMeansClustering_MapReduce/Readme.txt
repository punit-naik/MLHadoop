The input file is just filled with delimited 2D points and this algorithm tries to cluster them.

Initially, the output folder needs to be created and must be filled with a file which contains the initial cluster centers which are mostly zero.

The old and new centers are tab separated. The centers on the left are old and the centers on the right are new. Initially both are zero.

This algorithms takes in 4 arguments as follows:

1. Number of centroids
2. The dimension of the input points
3. The input data
4. The output data
